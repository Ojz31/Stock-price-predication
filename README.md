# Netflix Stock Price Prediction

In this project, I built a predictive model for Netflix stock prices using Linear Regression and Random Forest. The data showed linear trends, making Linear Regression a suitable choice, while Random Forest provided a robust, non-linear alternative for comparison.

Key steps included:

- Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared the dataset by handling missing values, removing outliers, and ensuring data consistency.
- Visualization: Explored trends and patterns in the stock prices using line plots, histograms, and correlation heatmaps.
- Normalization: Experimented with normalizing the data to improve model performance and compared results before and after normalization.
- Model Training and Evaluation: Trained both models on the dataset and evaluated their performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² score.
This project highlights the importance of preprocessing and visualization in understanding financial data, as well as comparing multiple models to achieve reliable predictions.
